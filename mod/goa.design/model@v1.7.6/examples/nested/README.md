# Nested Example

This examples illustrates how multiple packages can be contribute to the same
design. This makes it possible for multiple teams to collaborate on the same
overall software architecture while maintaining only the section relevant to
them.

The example also illustrates how styles may be shared between multiple
designs by defining them in a shared Go package.

The nesting is done simply by leveraging Go `import`: the design being
generated imports the packages that defines the nested designs. The parent
design can refer to elements defined in the child designs by using the
functions exposed on the corresponding element structs:

* The `Person` and `SoftwareSystem` workspace methods return a person or
  software system element given their name.
* The `Container` software system method returns a container given its name.
* The `Component` container method returns a component given its name.
* The `DeploymentNode` workspace method returns a deployment node given its
  name, the `Child` deployment node method returns a child deployment node
  given its name.
* The `InfrastructureNode` deployment node method returns an infrastructure
  node given its name.
* The `ContainerInstance` deployment node method returns a container instance
  given a reference to the container being instantiated (or its name) and the
  corresponding instance ID (1 if there is only one instance of the container
  in the deployment node).

When used that way the `Design` expression defined in imported models gets
overridden by the one defined in the package being generated.

## Running

### Rendering the diagram locally

Use the `mdl` tool to serve the static page:

```bash
mdl serve goa.design/model/examples/nested/model
```

Open the pages for each view:

Subsystem 1 context view:

```bash
open http://http://localhost:6070/Subsystem%201%20context
```

Subsystem 2 context view:

```bash
open http://http://localhost:6070/Subsystem%202%20context
```

### Using the Structurizr service

Generate the Structurizr workspace from the design:

```bash
stz gen goa.design/model/examples/nested/model
```

This generates the file `model.json` that contains the JSON representation
of the design. This file can be uploaded to a Structurizr workspace, again
using `stz`:

```bash
stz put model.json -id XXX -key YYY -secret ZZZ
```

Where `XXX` is the Structurizr workspace ID, `YYY` the API key and `ZZZ` the
API secret.
