# Contributing to Model

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Model project! We
appreciate contributions via submitting Github issues and/or pull requests.

Below are some guidelines to follow when contributing to this project:

* Before opening an issue in Github, check
  [open issues](https://github.com/goadesign/model/issues) and
  [pull requests](https://github.com/goadesign/model/pulls) for
  existing issues and fixes.
* If your issue has not been addressed,
  [open a Github issue](https://github.com/goadesign/model/issues/new)
  and follow the checklist presented in the issue description section. A simple
  model DSL that reproduces your issue helps immensely.
* If you know how to fix your bug, we highly encourage PR contributions. See
  [How Can I Get Started section](#how-can-i-get-started?) on how to submit a PR.
* For feature requests and submitting major changes,
  [open an issue](https://github.com/goadesign/model/issues/new)
  or hop onto the Goa slack channel (see https://goa.design to join) to discuss
  the feature first.
* Keep conversations friendly! Constructive criticism goes a long way.
* Have fun contributing!

## How Can I Get Started?

1) Read the README carefully as well as details on the [C4 model](https://c4model.com)
   for more information on the C4 model.
2) To get your hands dirty, fork the model repo and issue PRs from the fork.
   **PRO Tip:** Add a [git remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote.html) to
   your forked repo in the source code (in $GOPATH/src/goa.design/model when
   installed using `go get`) to avoid messing with import paths while testing
   your fix.
3) [Open issues](https://github.com/goadesign/model/issues) labeled as `good first
   issue` are ideal to understand the source code and make minor contributions.
   Issues labeled `help wanted` are bugs/features that are not currently being
   worked on and contributing to them are most welcome.
4) Link the issue that the PR intends to solve in the PR description. If an issue
   does not exist, adding a description in the PR that describes the issue and the
   fix is recommended.
5) Ensure the CI build passes when you issue a PR to Goa.
7) Join our slack channel(the Goa slack channgel, see https://goa.design to join) and 
   participate in the conversations.
