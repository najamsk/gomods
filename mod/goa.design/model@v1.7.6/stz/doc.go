Package stz complements the serializable model defined in mdl package
with data specific to Structurizr service.

The top level data structure is Workspace which replaces mdl.Design.

The JSON representation of the workspace data structure is compatible with
the Structurizr service API (https://structurizr.com). The package also
includes a Structurize API client that can be used to upload and download
workspaces to and from the service.
